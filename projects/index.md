This page hosts the main projects I work or have worked on (in chronological order).

1. UrbanPy:

    I'm one of the core developers of UrbanPy, a Python library for urban spatial analysis that provides a friendly API to download, process and visualize urban data. The current features provide downloads from the Humanitarian Data Exchange repository, administrative boundaries from OSM, road network downloads from OSM and processing into GeoDataFrames using the GeoPandas API. We also include functionality for accessibility computation, such as isochrones and indicators from relevant literature (such as "pressure") and these are developed constantly. From a visualization standpoint, we rely on the (Geo)Pandas API to plot using matplotlib while exploring features involving PyDeck.
    Finally, to aggregate and processes these datasets we use the H3 hexagonal index system, from which we can generate layers of data that provide granular or coarse representations of urban data. For a deeper dive into the features, check out [the UrbanPy GitHub repo](https://github.com/EL-BID/urbanpy)
